### Examples
Website is simple Javascript project that shows information retrieved from your own API and from an optional external API. API hS an Express server built in NodeJS that handles any resource.  there is an endpoint for retrieving all entities from your resource (GET) and an endpoint for creating a new entity (POST) and also the API will be expanded with endpoints to update an entity (PUT), delete an entity (DELETE) and retrieve a specific entity (GET). It should be clear in your client interface that you retrieves data from an external optional API. Data that is retrieved must therefore be displayed in your interface.
